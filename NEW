I can see that you're encountering an error with the DHCP service failing to start. Let's fix this issue.

The error message shows:
```
Job for dhcpd.service failed because the control process exited with error code.
See "systemctl status dhcpd.service" and "journalctl -xeu dhcpd.service" for details.
```

First, let's check the detailed error message to understand what's causing the problem:

```bash
sudo systemctl status dhcpd.service
```

And also check the journal logs:

```bash
sudo journalctl -xeu dhcpd.service
```

Based on common issues with DHCP service failures, here are some possible solutions:

1. Check your DHCP configuration file for syntax errors:

```bash
sudo dhcpd -t -cf /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
```

2. The most likely issue is a syntax error in your dhcpd.conf file. Let's edit it and make sure it's correct:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
```

Here's a simplified and corrected DHCP configuration with DDNS that should work:

```
# DHCP with DDNS Configuration
authoritative;

# Define the DDNS key (must match the key in named.conf)
key "ddns-key" {
    algorithm hmac-sha256;
    secret "YourStaticSecretKey123456789";
}

# Basic DDNS configuration
ddns-update-style interim;
ddns-updates on;
update-static-leases on;
ignore client-updates;

# Domain configuration
option domain-name "est.intra";
option domain-name-servers 192.168.1.1;

# DDNS zones
zone est.intra. {
    primary 192.168.1.1;
    key ddns-key;
}

zone 1.168.192.in-addr.arpa. {
    primary 192.168.1.1;
    key ddns-key;
}

# Subnet declaration
subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
    range 192.168.1.100 192.168.1.200;
    option routers 192.168.1.1;
    default-lease-time 3600;
    max-lease-time 7200;
}
```

3. Make sure you have the correct interface specified for DHCP. Check which interface DHCP should be listening on:

```bash
ip a
```

Then edit the DHCP service configuration:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/sysconfig/dhcpd
```

Add your network interface name to the DHCPDARGS line:
```
DHCPDARGS="eth0"  # Replace eth0 with your actual interface name
```

4. Ensure your network interface is up and has the correct IP:

```bash
sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.1/24 dev eth0  # Replace eth0 with your interface name
sudo ip link set eth0 up
```

5. If the above doesn't work, check for any conflicting DHCP servers on your network and also check for permission issues:

```bash
sudo chown root:root /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
sudo chmod 644 /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
```

After making these changes, try restarting the DHCP service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart dhcpd
```

If you're still facing issues, please share the output of `systemctl status dhcpd.service` so I can provide more specific guidance.
